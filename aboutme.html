    <p2>Future plans: Robert J. Lang, a former physicist from NASA, decided to quit his job at NASA to pursue a career involving his passion for origami. He learned that by applying math to his origami, he would be able to create cylindrical geometries capable of fitting inside a rocket. Thus, this would provide more clear ways of folding satellites into rockets that could unfold in an organized manner once released into space. Three years ago, after watching a Facebook video publicizing this information, I was deeply inspired; I have always held fervor for anything that allowed me to work with my hands, origami being one of those activities that helped fulfill this ardor of mine. Moreover, I too have been able to experience love for physics through my physics and engineering courses at school. Thus, this Facebook video, which motivated me to enroll in the PLTW courses and Physics classes in high school, largely inspired me to pursue engineering in college. In order to accomplish my goal of working alongside minds in the realm of Robert Lang's, I hope to go to college to study physics and aerospace engineering.</p2>
